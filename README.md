# Full Stack API Final Project

## Full Stack Trivia

Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game, but their API experience was limited and still needed to be built out.

My task was to finish the trivia app so they can start holding trivia and seeing who's the most knowledgeable of the bunch. The application met the following MVP criteria when I was done:

1. Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
2. Delete questions.
3. Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4. Search for questions based on a text query string.
5. Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.

Completing this trivia app gave me the ability to structure plan, implement, and test an API server in a professional manner.

## Tech Stack

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a completed Flask, PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy server. The README.md file in that directory also contains the documentation for the API endpoints.

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server.
